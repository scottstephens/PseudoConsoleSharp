# PseudoConsoleSharp
C# wrapper around Windows pseudoconsole API

# Credits
This project was adapted from [sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/tree/main/samples/ConPTY/MiniTerm) in the 
[Microsoft Terminal project](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) by Will Fuqua 
([@waf](https://github.com/waf)).

# Status
This project didn't get very far and I do not intend to continue development because the ConPTY API ended up not solving the problems I was hoping it would solve.

Probably not usable in its current form, but leaving it around in case I change my mind or it may be a useful starting point for someone.
